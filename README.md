# OverPowered
Designed to provide large businesses with many buildings an option to remotely control their power usage via a web-based utility.
Users were to be alerted of power overconsumption based on a decision tree (trained by data from Georgia Power) and have the option
to shut off devices from a built website.

6 week Summer 2018 Software Engineering Project; 4 weeks of planning, 2 weeks of coding.

I served as Project Manager for this, composing sequence diagrams, class diagrams, use cases, tests, delegating tasks, managing schedules,
etc. etc.

This project- completed using the Waterfall model of sequential design- really highlighted why Agile methods (Scrum, XP) are so quickly
and ubiquitously being adopted.
